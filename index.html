		<h2> Overview </h2>
		WolfreeAlpha <i><small>(the “Wolfree Websites” or the “Service”)</small></i> is part of the Wolfree Project.
		The programmers developing the Service <i><small>(the “Wolfree Developers” or the “Developers”)</small></i> use <a href="https://products.wolframalpha.com/api/documentation/">Wolfram|Alpha Full Results API</a> to access complete step-by-step solutions.
		The Developers' use of Wolfram|Alpha Full Results API is subject to the <a href="https://products.wolframalpha.com/api/termsofuse.html">Wolfram|Alpha API Terms of Use</a>.
		The Developers host this Service to share step-by-step solutions with you <i><small>(the “Wolfree Users” or the “Users”)</small></i> for free.
		<h2> Notice </h2>
		<h3> Distributing the output of algorithms </h3>
		Like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Copilot">GitHub Copilot</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter">Jupyter Notebook</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search">Google Search</a>, the Wolfree Project is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">software as a service</a> (SaaS).
		The Wolfree Project may distribute mathematical expressions, step-by-step solutions, the output of scientific calculators, or other disputed contents.
		Publication of information found in the Wolfree Project may violate the laws in the country or jurisdiction from where you are viewing this information.
		<h3> No guarantee of validity </h3>
		Please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily been reviewed by people with the expertise required to provide you with complete, accurate, or reliable information.
		The Wolfree Project cannot guarantee the validity of the information found here.
		Note that most other encyclopedias and reference works also have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Non-Wikipedia_disclaimers">disclaimers</a>.
		<h3> No legal opinion </h3>
		There may be legal, medical, mathematics, or other information that is also the subject of professional opinions; the Wolfree Project is not a substitute for seeking the help of a professional.
		If you need specific advice, please seek a professional who is licensed or knowledgeable in that area.
		The Wolfree Project does not give legal advice, medical advice, or mathematics advice.
		<h2> FAQ: exceptions to copyright</h2>
		The exceptions to copyright allow limited use of copyright works without permission from the copyright owner.
		Users can skip this section if these exceptions cover them.
		In most jurisdictions, you can browse the Wolfree Websites when the use is non-commercial research or private study, though you must be genuinely studying like you would if you took a college course.
		<h3> Will I get in trouble with my Internet provider (ISP) or copyright lawyers if I read the mathematical expressions on the Wolfree Websites? </h3>
		No case exists of someone being sued for consuming a copyrighted book, song, or movie from a website.
		Reading the mathematical expressions on the Wolfree Websites is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_sharing">filesharing</a> (P2P), so copyright holders can not find out who is visiting WolfreeAlpha, and they would not care if they knew.
		The Wolfree Developers are the real targets of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint">complaints</a> because the Developers are the ones distributing step-by-step solutions, not the Users.
		Thousands of students and scientists around the world safely visit WolfreeAlpha every day, so you are in good company.
		<h3> Why do the complaints target the Developers and not the Users? </h3>
		The reason is that the Developers set up web servers that facilitate the unauthorized distribution of step-by-step solutions.
		In comparison, the Users only read the solutions and do not re-share them.
		Copyright does not protect ideas, nor does it protect facts.
		It protects only the form in which ideas or facts are expressed.
		For example, you may read a copyrighted step-by-step solution and appropriate the ideas or facts it conveys into your work without violating the copyright.
		However, you may not reproduce the actual text of the step-by-step solution (unless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">fair use</a> or another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitations_and_exceptions_to_copyright">exception to copyright</a> protection applies), nor may you evade this prohibition simply by changing some words or thoroughly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrasing_of_copyrighted_material">paraphrasing</a> the content.
		<h3> Can I share screenshots of these mathematical expressions online? </h3>
		Reading these mathematical expressions for personal use falls into the categories of either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea%e2%80%93expression_distinction">idea-expression distinction</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing">fair dealing</a>.
		But public distribution – by uploading or otherwise offering to share copyright-protected content – remains illegal in most, if not all, countries.
		Reading the step-by-step solutions on the Wolfree Websites is safe in most jurisdictions worldwide that respect freedom.
		However, do not share screenshots of these mathematical expressions online as this may constitute copyright infringement.
		<h3> Can I use my browser to display these mathematical expressions on the Internet during my math lectures? </h3>
		Several exceptions allow the use of copyright works for educational purposes, such as performing, playing, or showing copyright works in universities or other educational establishments.
		However, it only applies if the audience is limited to teachers, pupils, and others directly connected with the activities of the establishment.
		Examples of this are showing a mathematical expression for calculus lessons and the teaching of math.
		<h3> Can I post the URL I found on this site on the Internet? </h3>
		In some jurisdictions, posting certain URLs on the Internet may infringe copyright.
		Please see:
		<ul>
			<li><code><a>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_aspects_of_hyperlinking_and_framing</a></code></li>
		</ul>
		<h2> FAQ: complaints about copyright infringement </h2>
		This site may contain disputed computational output from scientific calculators.
		As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult a professional about your specific questions or situation.
		The Wolfree Developers strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights.
		All content on this site is not legal advice and should not be taken as such.
		<h3> What is the DMCA “notice and takedown” process? </h3>
		The DMCA <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_and_take_down">notice and takedown</a> process are used for complaints about copyright infringement.
		See also:
		<ul>
			<li><code><a>https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/DMCA_Policy</a></code></li>
			<li><code><a>https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy</a></code></li>
		</ul>
		<h3> How do I take down a website for copyright infringement? </h3>
		The Copyright Act allows copyright owners to sue infringers, which can be expensive and time-consuming.
		The DMCA notice and takedown process is much cheaper and takes less time.
		If the mathematical expressions being output by scientific calculators infringe your copyright, the Wolfree Developers encourage you to seek resolution through the DMCA notice and takedown process.
		Some success stories of the DMCA notice and takedown process are:
		<ul>
			<li><code><a>https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2021/08/2021-08-11-wolfram.md</a></code></li>
			<li><code><a>https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2021/08/2021-08-16-wolfram.md</a></code></li>
		</ul>
		<h3> Who should I send the DMCA notices to? </h3>
		You should send your DMCA notice to the service provider responsible for the site.
		For example, the source code for this website is available at:
		<ul>
			<li><code><a>https://git.kiwifarms.net/wolfree</a></code></li>
		</ul>
		The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_service_provider">online service provider</a> (OSP) for git.kiwifarms.net is kiwifarms.net.
		If you believe the source code constitutes copyright infringement, please send a DMCA notice to the administrators of kiwifarms.net.
		For information on how to contact the administrators of kiwifarms.net, please see: 
		<ul>
			<li><code><a>https://kiwifarms.net/help/removing-content/</a></code></li>
		</ul>
		<h2> FAQ: the Wolfree ecosystem </h2>
		The Wolfree Project aims to integrate interactive and programmatic access to the full power of the <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/tour">WolframAlpha computational knowledge engine</a>.
		The Wolfree Project leverages the <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/language/index.php.en">Wolfram Language</a> to allow free-form linguistic input of computations and programs.
		The Wolfree Project brings extensive data and computation capabilities that rely on the <a href="https://www.wolfram.com/knowledgebase/index.html.en">Wolfram knowledgebase</a> and curated data.
		<h3> How do I contact the Wolfree Developers? </h3>
		The Developers check email twice a year.
		Use the Fediverse to send urgent messages.
		Publicly reply to pinned posts on the Fediverse to get a quicker response from the community.
		<br>
		Fediverse: <a href="https://kiwifarms.cc/wolfree">@wolfree@kiwifarms.cc</a>
		<br>
		Email: hb4lhgu0h@mozmail.com
		<h3> How do I contact the Wolfree Developers on the Fediverse? </h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Choose a Fediverse instance, e.g.,<br><a href="https://soapbox.pub/soapbox-portfolio/">Soapbox Pub</a>, <a href="https://pleroma.social/#featured-instances">Pleroma Social</a>, <a href="https://join.misskey.page/en-US/instances">Misskey</a>, or <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities">Mastodon</a>.</li>
			<li>Create an account and sign in.</li>
			<li>Send your message to the Developers' inbox.</li>
		</ol>
		<h3> How do I contact the Wolfree Developers by Email? </h3>
		<ol>
			<li> Choose an Email service provider, e.g., <br> ProtonMail, Disroot, Tutanota, or Gmail. </li>
			<li> Create an account and sign in. </li>
			<li> Send your message to the Developers' inbox. </li>
		</ol>
		<h3> Why do the Wolfree Developers prefer federated social networks? </h3>
		Everybody knows that you do not have to use the same email provider to communicate via email.
		You can send a mail from @protonmail.com to @gmail.com and the other way around.
		The federation on the Fediverse works in the same way.
		It means that different or decentralized servers or instances can communicate with each other via a protocol.
		Like email uses POP, IMAP, or SMTP protocols for federation, the Fediverse uses ActivityPub.

		</ul>
		<h3> Why do the Wolfree Developers prefer copyleft licenses? </h3>
		Copyleft licenses work like permissive licenses with a catch: they require sharing and licensing the source code for new software built with copyleft-licensed software as open software, too.
		For this reason, copyleft licenses are also “share-alike” licenses, though “copyleft” is the term you will hear most in software.

		<h2> FAQ: freedom of information </h2>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information">Freedom of information</a> is the freedom of people to publish and consume information.
		Access to information is the ability of an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively.
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_freedom">Intellectual freedom</a> encompasses the freedom to hold, receive, and disseminate ideas without restriction.
		The extent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship">Internet censorship</a> varies on a country-to-country basis.
		Most countries enforce minimal Internet censorship.
		Users in these countries can skip this section.
		<h3> How do I get around Internet filtering? </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Enable <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/dns/">DoH</a>,
				e.g., <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/encrypted-dns-browsers/">1.1.1.1</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Install <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/vpn/">a free VPN</a>,
				e.g., <a href="https://protonvpn.com/">ProtonVPN</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Download <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/browsers/">a browser that circumvents censorship</a>, <br>
				e.g., <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Browser</a>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		Unless you are an information security expert, do not use DoH, VPN, and Tor at the same time.
		Pick only one of them.
		If unsure, learn how to use Tor safely.
		<h3> Should I use DoH, VPN, or Tor? </h3>
		DoH will not help you hide any of your browsing activity and should only be used to get around basic DNS blocking when you can be sure there will not be any consequences.
		Using a VPN will not keep your browsing habits anonymous or add additional security to non-secure (HTTP) traffic.
		In locations where there is Internet filtering (or censorship), visiting forbidden resources may have consequences that you should consider in your <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/basics/threat-modeling/">threat model</a>.
		The Wolfree Developers do not suggest the use of DoH or VPN for this purpose.
		Use Tor instead.
		<h3> Do I need to use Tor to access WolfreeAlpha? </h3>
		Unless you live in a country without intellectual freedom, where reading certain mathematical expressions is banned, you do not need to use Tor.
		But if you can not access WolfreeAlpha because your country blocks it, Tor will unlock access.
		<h3> Should I use Tor to browse WolfreeAlpha? </h3>
		If reading the mathematical expressions on the Wolfree Websites is legal in your jurisdiction, you do not need to use Tor.
		If unsure, learn how to use Tor safely.
		<h3> What if my government made the use of Tor a felony? </h3>
		This level of intellectual freedom is too much for your jurisdiction.
		For your safety, avoid using Tor if it is illegal where you live.
		Most Users value their freedom of movement more than their freedom to read.
